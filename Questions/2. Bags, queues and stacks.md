### 2. Bags, queues and stacks

**Bags** is a type of collection or an iterable which is very simple as it is not concerned with the order in which the items a put into the bag. It is only interested in being able to tell the size, if empty, grab a random item from the bag or if an item is present in the bag. Though this is not the optimal collection for searching as it is not possible to sort the items but you can still use it to iterate through if you don't care about the order. The main difference in this collection from others are that you are not able to remove items that has been added to the bag.

**Queues** are also a collection type that is iterable, it is what we call a FIFO collection which means first in first out. This collection has a dequeue method which makes it possible to remove items from the queue which in a FIFO will be the first item.

**Stacks** is the last collection we will discuss here and is like the queue a collection where you have the ability to remove items. This is a LIFO collection or push down collection where the last item added is the first item to be removed, hence the push down referral.
