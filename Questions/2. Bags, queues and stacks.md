### 2. Bags, queues and stacks

**Bags** is a type of collection or an iterable which is very simple as it is not concerned with the order in which the items a put into the bag. It is only interested in being able to tell the size, if empty, grab a random item from the bag or if an item is present in the bag. Though this is not the optimal collection for searching as it is not possible to sort the items but you can still use it to iterate through if you don't care about the order.
